    <h3>What is quorum intersection?</h3>
    <p class="my-4">
      A property of the network that indicates all quorums are overlapping.
    </p>
    <h3>Why is quorum intersection needed?</h3>
    <p class="my-4">
      Because it is prerequisite for network safety. If not all quorums overlap,
      they could make different decisions and thus split the network.
    </p>
    <h3>What are minimal quorums?</h3>
    <p class="my-4">
      A minimal quorum is a set of nodes/organizations/... that form a quorum
      but does not contain another quorum. If all minimal quorums intersect, it
      can be shown that the network has quorum intersection. If you want to
