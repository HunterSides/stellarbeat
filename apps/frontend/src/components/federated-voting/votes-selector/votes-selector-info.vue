    <h3>Vote Selection</h3>
    <p>
      The vote selector allows you to cast the initial votes for nodes in the
      network:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Available Options:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Burger üçî</li>
          <li>Pizza üçï</li>
          <li>Salad ü•ó</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Vote validity</strong> All voting options are 'valid' for every
        Node. Unlike real validators that could reject statements/votes if it
        contains for example an invalid transaction that is incompatible with
        its history.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User action</strong> Selecting a vote creates a UserAction that
        you can observe in the Events and Actions dashboard component. The
        UserAction is executed when advancing to the next simulation step.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Processing:</strong> Once a vote is processed, it cannot be
        changed (unless you go back in the simulation)
      </li>
    </ul>
