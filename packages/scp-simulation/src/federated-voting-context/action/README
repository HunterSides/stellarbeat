# Actions

There are two kind of actions. The ones the user initiates and the ones the
protocol initiates.

Actions can be canceled, tampered with,... They give the user an entry point to
modify the protocol or the circumstances (quorumsets, node connections,...)

This entry point is provided between every communication over the network.

In contrast to events which report what happened in the past.
